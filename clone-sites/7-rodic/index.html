          <p>Rodić Davidson: London Architecture</p>
          <p>
            Our Bloomsbury based practice has been working in central London
            since 2006. Having worked within the oldest areas of London, we have
            developed an expertise in historic buildings. These are often Listed
            and situated within a Conservation Area. Our knowledge and
            experience consistently secure Planning Consents, Listed Building
            Consents and Great Estate Licenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many areas within central London boroughs were originally developed
            by aristocratic families (examples being Grosvenor, Cadogan, De
            Walden, Portman and Bedford), and these family estates still own
            large swathes of, what is now commonly referred to as, Prime Central
            London. These Great Estates maintain significant influence either
            through direct ownership or through various stewardship schemes, an
            example being the Belgrave Estate Management Scheme administered by
            Grosvenor. Schemes such as this enable the Estate to exert control
            over the use, development, and appearance of the designated area.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a growing body of new-build work in Prime Central London and
            elsewhere the UK. Through sensitive, contextual design and iterative
            dialogue with Clients and Planners, Rodić Davidson have established
            a track record of obtaining difficult planning consents for both
            new-build and existing properties.

          <p>Who are we?</p>
          <p>
            We are Rodić Davidson, an award winning, architecture, design, and
            interiors studio with the belief that buildings are more than brick
            and mortar; they are an extension of ourselves and our environment.
            Our practice specializes in design-led and highly crafted
            renovations and new-builds. We pride ourselves on an ability to
            deliver thoughtful and imaginative design whilst safeguarding our
            clients’ commercial interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rodić Davidson Architects are an award-winning RIBA Chartered
            Practice based in Bloomsbury, central London. Whilst the heart of
            our work is local to us in London, the practice has an expanding
            portfolio of work across the UK; predominantly in the east and
            southeast of England but also including projects reaching as far as
            Scotland. We have experience working in rural locations,
            particularly in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and Sussex where we have
            undertaken a number of farmstead and country house projects, often
            for London or overseas-based clients. These projects often involve
            sensitive restoration of listed buildings, usually with some more
            contemporary new-build additions. The practice prides itself on
            achieving the right design solution which celebrates heritage while
            recognizing that buildings are now required to perform different
            functions and should consume less carbon in doing so. In striving
            for lower carbon solutions, we look to insulate well and integrate
            renewable technologies wherever possible.
