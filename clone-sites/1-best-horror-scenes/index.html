        <h1>BEST HORROR SCENES</h1>
        <h4>
          An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in
          horror.
        </h4>
        <p>
          “Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the
          most affecting in horror. Some may be simple black cat scares, others
          may be more subdued or nuanced. Many come from films that aren't
          necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.

                    When I discover a film I feel is really special in some way,
                    I usually drag as many people to the theater as possible to
                    see it with me before it’s banished to the streaming realm
                    forever. I’m always excited by the challenge of choosing
                    people I’m sure will enjoy it as much as I do, but I’m not
                    always right.

                    With Under the Skin (2013), I had about a 50% success rate
                    with people either really loving it or really hating it.
                    With Let the Right One In (2008), I hit a near 100% success
                    rate with the only complaint being having to read subtitles
                    (which is clearly not a complaint about the movie and says
                    more about the viewer). With Blue Ruin I hit my first home
                    run (did I use that sportsball metaphor correctly?). Now,
                    I’ve only shared it with about 4–5 people, but across the
                    board everyone really loved the movie.

                    Director Jeremy Saulnier needs to write the handbook for
                    making great films on a small budget. The budget for this
                    film was around $420,000, which is just remarkable. I’ve
                    never made a film, but this just seems like an impossible
                    challenge. I’d love to know how they pulled it off. I’m so
                    glad they did.
